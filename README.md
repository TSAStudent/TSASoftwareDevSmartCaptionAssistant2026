Smart Classroom Caption and Notes Assistant

This is a Next.js web app that gives live speech-to-text captions in the classroom and helps students review and organize what was said. Users can sign in with Google or continue as a guest. While someone is speaking, the app shows real-time captions and can label who is talking (teacher vs. student) using voice identification. Students can bookmark moments, replay the last few seconds, and open an AI-powered notes panel that uses the OpenAI API to generate summaries, bullet points, and key terms from the transcript. Caption settings (dark mode, font size, teacher-only mode) and, for signed-in users, classes and saved sessions (with full caption text and speaker labels) are stored in Firebase so they sync across devices. The app also supports vocabulary topics (e.g., AP Physics, Calculus) to highlight defined terms in the captions, full-screen caption view, and a Deepgram API setup for speaker identification. **Note:** API keys and secrets (OpenAI, Google OAuth, NextAuth, Firebase, Deepgram) used are not included in this repository for security reasons.
